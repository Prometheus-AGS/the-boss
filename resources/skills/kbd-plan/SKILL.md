name: kbd-plan
description: Use to create a prioritized, ordered change list for the current KBD project phase. Project-agnostic — reads the assessment and project constraints to produce an ordered change list, auto-detecting OpenSpec availability and emitting the appropriate change format.

# /kbd-plan

Run the **Plan** phase of the KBD lifecycle for any project.

## What this does

Reads `.kbd-orchestrator/phases/<phase-name>/assessment.md` and produces an
ordered list of changes to implement this phase. Refreshes the waypoint so
every tool knows the exact next step.

Output:

- `.kbd-orchestrator/phases/<phase-name>/plan.md` — ordered change list
- `.kbd-orchestrator/current-waypoint.md` and `current-waypoint.json` — refreshed

## Analyze inputs (when the Analyze stage ran)

When `.kbd-orchestrator/phases/<phase>/library-candidates.json` exists, read it
before ordering changes:

- A change addressing a gap whose candidate has verdict `adopt` or `adapt`
  carries a `library: cand-###` annotation in `plan.md` and, for OpenSpec, the
  candidate's evidence block in the design doc — the change *reuses* the library
  rather than rebuilding it.
- `build_required[]` entries (gaps with no adoptable candidate) become build
  changes; a `capability_gap_id` (when present) marks a blocked-on dependency.

When no `library-candidates.json` exists (Analyze skipped), plan as before.

## OpenSpec Detection

Before emitting changes, detect the change management backend:

1. **Check for `openspec/` directory** at project root
2. **Check for `openspec/` directory** inside the skill being developed
3. **Check `.kbd-orchestrator/project.json`** for `"change_backend": "openspec"`

If any of these exist, emit changes as OpenSpec structures. Otherwise, use
native KBD change files.

```
OpenSpec detected?
  YES → emit /opsx:new <change-id> commands
      → create openspec/changes/<change-id>/proposal.md
      → tasks tracked in openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md
  NO  → create .kbd-orchestrator/changes/<change-id>/change.md
      → tasks tracked inline with [ ] / [/] / [x] markers
```

## Progress Signals (MANDATORY)

**FIRST tool call of every turn:** Read `.kbd-orchestrator/position-reminder.txt` (if it exists) to get the current phase, step N of T, and next command. If that file is absent, read `.kbd-orchestrator/current-waypoint.json`.

Before any other action, emit to plain response text (BEFORE any tool call):

```
Starting kbd-plan — <phase-name> (step N of T)
```

When all steps are complete, emit:

```
Completed kbd-plan — <phase-name> (step N of T)
```

**How to get N and T (MANDATORY — never estimate):** read
`completion.implementation.completed`/`.total` from `progress.json` via
`implementationCompleted(progress)`/`implementationTotal(progress)`
(`lib/kbd/progress.mjs`), falling back to `current-waypoint.json`'s
`implementationCompleted`/`implementationTotal` when `progress.json` is
absent.

Use the canonical phase name from the argument or `current-waypoint.json`. Emit to plain response text — no tool call needed.

## How to invoke

1. **Discover project identity** — read `.kbd-orchestrator/project.json` or infer
2. **Confirm the active phase** — from argument or waypoint
3. **Load assessment** — from `.kbd-orchestrator/phases/<phase>/assessment.md`
4. **Read project constraints** — from `AGENTS.md` and project spec files
5. **Detect change backend** — OpenSpec or native KBD (see OpenSpec Detection)
6. **Write plan.md** with ordered change list and recommended agent per change
7. **Adversarial vet** — when `adversarial-review` is installed and
   `--skip-adversarial-review` was not passed, run it in artifact mode against
   the written plan. CRITICAL findings (ordering errors, missing dependencies,
   untestable criteria) → revise `plan.md` and re-vet (max 2 rounds, then
   accept with an "Unresolved review findings" section appended). WARNING
   findings → carry into the stage handoff summary. Vet **before** emitting
   change structures, so a corrected plan never leaves stale changes behind.
8. **Emit change structures** via OpenSpec or native KBD
9. **Refresh waypoint** files (`current-waypoint.md` and `current-waypoint.json`)

## Examples

```
/kbd-plan                                # uses active waypoint phase
/kbd-plan phase-1-foundation             # explicit phase name
```

## Hook integration

Fire `plan:before` before reading the assessment, `plan:after` after
writing `plan.md`, via `hooksFire('plan', 'before'|'after', name, index, total, ctx)`
from `lib/kbd/hooks.mjs`. Existing Progress Signals are unchanged.

```js
import { hooksFire } from '../../lib/kbd/hooks.mjs';

await hooksFire('plan', 'before', phase, 1, 1, { orchestratorRoot, cwd, runCommand });
// … draft plan.md …
await hooksFire('plan', 'after', phase, 1, 1, { orchestratorRoot, cwd, runCommand });
```

See the parent `kbd-process-orchestrator` skill's "Hooks" section for taxonomy
and payload.

## Stage gate & handoff

The plan gate requires the assess handoff (walking back across the optional
analyze/spec stages when they have no handoff). After writing `plan.md`,
record the handoff that execute reads first:

```js
import { stageGate, stageHandoffWrite } from '../../lib/kbd/stage-gate.mjs';

const gate = stageGate('plan', { cwd });
if (gate.status !== 0) throw new Error(gate.stderr);

// … draft plan.md, adversarial vet …

stageHandoffWrite(
  'plan',
  '<1–3 sentences: change count, ordering rationale, first change to apply; include any WARNING findings from adversarial review>',
  ['plan.md'],
  { cwd },
);
```

Phases without a `handoffs/` directory are legacy: `stageGate` warns and still
passes. A deliberate stage skip is recorded with
`stageHandoffSkip('plan', '<reason>', { cwd })`.
