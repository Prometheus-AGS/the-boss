# Prometheus Context Bootstrap

Install the compact resident contract, path-scoped stack rules, and project-local
skill copies. The bootstrap owns only marked regions. It preserves prose outside
those markers and refuses a corrupt marker pair or a symlink that resolves outside
the target project.

The generated policy finishes coherent production functionality before testing.
It treats the smallest real integration flow at a completed change or phase boundary
as evidence. Unit, mock-only, filtered-function, and per-edit test loops do not count
as completion proof.

## Run from the mini pack

From a standalone mini checkout:

```text
node scripts/prometheus-context-bootstrap.mjs --path <project> --stacks rust,typescript
node scripts/prometheus-context-bootstrap.mjs --path <project> --stacks rust,typescript --check
```

From the copy vendored inside `the-boss`:

```text
node resources/prometheus-skills-mini/scripts/prometheus-context-bootstrap.mjs --path . --stacks typescript,rust
node resources/prometheus-skills-mini/scripts/prometheus-context-bootstrap.mjs --path . --stacks typescript,rust --check
```

Use `--dry-run` to print the complete write plan without changing files. If
`--stacks` is absent, a root `Cargo.toml` selects Rust and a root `package.json`
selects TypeScript.

## Installed context

- a marked resident block in `AGENTS.md`, or in the in-project target of an
  existing `AGENTS.md` symlink;
- an `@AGENTS.md` import in a separate `CLAUDE.md`;
- marked `.claude/rules/rust.md` and/or `typescript.md` regions;
- copied `prometheus-context-bootstrap` and, for Rust, `prometheus-rust-workspace`
  skills under both `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/`;
- missing append-only `.prometheus` context files and directories.

The Rust path rule loads `prometheus-rust-workspace`, which routes
`rust-best-practices`, `rust-async-patterns`, `rust-mcp-server-generator`, and
the specialized catalog only when relevant. Dependency and protocol pins in the
target project remain authoritative.

## Delivery cadence context

When `.prometheus/cadence-binding.json` exists, read that small binding and carry its profile/root into the execution dispatch. Load delivery-cadence only for cadence-enabled work. Its configured build-and-run boundary, publication frequency and pending failure obligations survive compaction; do not substitute test suites or silently reset the run. No profile means no additional cadence context.
