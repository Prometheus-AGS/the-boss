description: "Prepare and accept a durable handoff between agent roles or coding harnesses using task context, Git identity, evidence and memory references. Use when work must continue in another harness or agent; use agent-team-manage for ordinary same-owner task updates. Do not use for ordinary same-owner task updates (see agent-team-manage)."

compatibility: Requires Node.js 22 or newer. Git is optional for handoff snapshots. Model gateways, memory services and native harness CLIs are optional and separately configured.

# Agent Team Handoff

Load the existing state and companion `agent-team-creator` runtime. Read its
`references/task-handoff.md` for exact request shapes. Preserve the active KBD
identity if present; do not create a competing canonical task.

1. Read current state and task revisions. Identify the actual source owner and
   destination role/harness. Capture completed work, concrete evidence, remaining
   work, blockers and memory references. Do not summarize away dirty or unknown
   Git state.
2. Run `handoff-create` with the source owner, expected task revision, destination
   and repository path. The runtime captures Git HEAD/branch/status read-only
   and stores a fresh-context prompt and immutable packet. Ownership stays with
   the source at this point.
   Select source/evidence/Karpathy files and existing outbox memory IDs with
   `handoff.provenance` as documented in the task/handoff reference. Only hashes
   and scoped identities travel. Supply an explicit canonical CLI and path when
   observing linked KBD work; otherwise its observation remains unknown.
3. Deliver the packet through an authorized local file or existing communication
   mechanism. Do not send Slack/email messages without authorization. Source
   sessions, private credentials and permissions never become destination authority.
4. In the destination, read current project instructions and inspect the packet
   as task data. Run read-only `handoff-inspect` to compare selected identities:
   matches, changed, missing or unobserved. Legacy packets report provenance
   unavailable. Inspect evidence, current revision and destination capabilities;
   a scoped reference does not widen memory access. Explicitly accept with
   the named destination role/harness using `handoff-accept`.
5. Only acceptance transfers local ownership. A stale/reassigned/cancelled task
   refuses transfer. Repeating the same unchanged acceptance is idempotent;
   later task changes require reconciliation rather than an old receipt replay.

```text
node <agent-team-creator>/scripts/cli.mjs handoff-create --input handoff-request.json
node <agent-team-creator>/scripts/cli.mjs handoff-inspect --input inspection.json
node <agent-team-creator>/scripts/cli.mjs handoff-accept --input acceptance.json
```

Start a fresh native destination context from the saved prompt. Use the current
harness’s real resume interface only for that same harness/session when useful;
there is no portable session token. A state transfer does not stop the source
process. Coordinate stopping or pausing native work to prevent concurrent edits.

For shared memory, use the creator’s durable local queue and verified/configured
provider mappings described in `references/models-memory.md`. Scope and
provenance travel with the record, but a memory reference grants no authorization.
Unavailable services leave the local packet usable. Ambiguous publication needs
remote reconciliation before an explicitly authorized retry.

Karpathy progress is recorded only by the existing canonical boundary flow,
and `pk` owns knowledge bundles. Never write those stores directly or report
handoff acceptance as successful task completion. Finish with packet ID, current
owner/revision, acceptance state, evidence and unresolved work.
