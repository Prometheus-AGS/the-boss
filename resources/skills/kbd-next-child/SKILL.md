name: kbd-next-child
description: Advance childPointer to the next entry in childPhases[], or jump to a named child directly. Fires child:after for the closing child and child:before for the new active child. Refuses to advance past the last child (suggesting /kbd-reflect + /kbd-next-phase instead).
---

# /kbd-next-child

Advance the active child within the current parent phase.

## What this does

1. With no argument: moves `childPointer` to the next entry in `childPhases[]` after the current pointer.
2. With `<child-name>`: jumps directly to that child (must already be in `childPhases[]`).
3. Fires `child:after` for the closing child (if any) before the waypoint flip; fires `child:before` for the new active child after the flip.
4. Refuses to advance past the last child — suggests `/kbd-reflect` then `/kbd-next-phase`.

## When to use

Move between children declared by `/kbd-new-child`. Use the no-arg form for linear traversal (work child 1 → 2 → 3); use the explicit form for random access.

## Progress Signals (MANDATORY)

```
Starting kbd-next-child — <parent>/<from> → <to>
Completed kbd-next-child — now on <parent>/<to>
```

Where `<from>` is `(none)` when no child was previously active.

## Prerequisites

- A top-level phase MUST be active.
- `childPhases[]` MUST be non-empty (run `/kbd-new-child` first).
- For the explicit form: `<child-name>` MUST already be in `childPhases[]`.

## How to invoke

```bash
boss-mini kbd-next-child.mjs [<child-name>]
```

## Examples

```
/kbd-next-child                  # linear advance from current pointer
/kbd-next-child auth-refactor    # explicit jump
```

## Hook integration

Fires `child:after` (closing child, if any) with the waypoint still describing the old pointer, then writes the waypoint, then fires `child:before` (new active child). This symmetry means a hook that reads on-disk state sees the closing context when `child:after` fires and the opening context when `child:before` fires.
